## Demo Code

The code I used for the demonstration is available for educational purposes in this repository.

To run the demo, begin by spinning up the demo server with `npm run start`.
Next, you'll need to simultaneously run the POST request script as well as the sampling script.
The script will run for 10 seconds and then automatically generate the flame graph. Open up your browser to view it.
